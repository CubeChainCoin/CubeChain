</h1>

CubeCoin is a community-focused cryptocurrency created to establish a new and vibrant community similar to the original crypto projects. Built on the MultiChain platform, CubeCoin aims to provide a simple and efficient blockchain experience without the complexities often associated with smart contracts.

The CubeCoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the CubeCoin blockchain network and utilizes a Proof of Work consensus mechanism. It is adapted from various successful cryptocurrencies to ensure stability and efficiency.

## Differences from Other Cryptocurrencies

CubeCoin is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complications.

Changes:
* Addresses start with `1` instead of other prefixes.
* Tailored for community engagement and participation.

## Usage üíª

To start your journey with CubeCoin, You must have multichain framework on your server .

The JSON-RPC API provided by CubeCoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `cubecoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `cubecoin-cli help <command>`.

### Ports

CubeCoin Core by default uses port `9561` for network communication that is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSON-RPC port can be opened, which defaults to port `9560` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended not to expose RPC ports to the public internet.
and there is no testnet at the moment.

| Function | Mainnet | Testnet |
| :------- | ------: | ------: |
| NET      |   9561  |   ----- |
| RPC      |   9560  |   ----- |
